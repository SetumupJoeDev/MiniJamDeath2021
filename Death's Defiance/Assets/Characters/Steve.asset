  m_characterSentences:
  - Where... where am I? Last thing I remember was... way back in the mine, had my
    pickaxe swinging from side to side, side-side to side...
  - Hm? What have I achieved with my life, you're asking me that? Well, I suppose
    I managed to desolate an entire ecosystem and build battery farms for the wildlife
    I poached...
  - I also robbed the local villagers of all their crops, beds, gems, metals, parts
    of their houses... what was the question again?
