  m_characterSentences:
  - Woah, wh-who are you!? Am I... dead? Dang it, I knew I shouldn't have taken so
    much before I got back on the bike.
  - I don't suppose you'd send me back, would ya? I'm sure my buddies are worryin'
    about me down there, probably got myself all over some poor S.O.B's windshield.
  - What would I do with the gift of a second chance? Er, I hadn't thought about
    it like that. Ought to give that some real thought I suppose. Not something I
    should rush into... unless there's a time limit here?
  - So uh... you sending me back down there or what?
  m_characterName: Kirk
  m_soulReapedResponse: Ah I see, my time has finally come. Well, time to see what
    the beer is like in the afterlife I guess.
  m_soulSparedResponse: You're sending me back down to Earth? Hell yeah! Good call
    my man, I'll make sure not to waste it!

  m_lifeEvents:
  - After waking up mangled on the side of the road, Kirk put an end to his vices
    and convinced his biker buddies to be a force for good and formed a travelling
    food bank.
