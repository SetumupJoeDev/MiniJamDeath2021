  m_characterSentences:
  - Ahhh, it's you. I knew I'd be seeing you soon, after I lost my husband I thought
    "It won't be long before it's my turn now."
  - What did I achieve? Not a great deal, I suppose. I worked to live as opposed
    to the inverse, and my husband and I used what little money we had to travel
    the world. Never settled down to stay in one place or have children. Lived life
    to the fullest, rather selfish I suppose.
  - I've had a good, long life. I'm ready to rest now, dear, thank you.
  - I'm afraid I have nothing left to tell you.
  m_characterName: Mary
  m_soulReapedResponse: I'm finally at peace... thank you.
  m_soulSparedResponse: Y-you're letting me go back? But I wanted to see my husband...
  m_wasSpared: 0
  m_lifeEvents:
  - Mary lived out the remainder of her days alone, with no family to comfort her,
    hoping that she would see her husband again soon...
