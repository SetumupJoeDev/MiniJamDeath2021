  m_characterSentences:
  - Am I... dead? Last I remember was the machine making that bright flash, then
    a sudden overwhelming feeling of strength before everything went cold and dark...
  - I'm just a kid... I haven't really done a lot. I collect comic books, I do ok
    in school, and I have a paper route but nothing sensational really... does that
    mean I don't get to wake up?
  - If there are people more deserving than me who can go back, that's ok... they
    deserve a second chance. They can have mine... I'll be ok in the afterlife, I'll
    even get to see my old dog again.
  - Have you made your decision, sir?
  m_characterName: Grant
  m_soulReapedResponse: I understand. There are probably like, cancer researchers
    you could be sending back. It's ok...
  m_soulSparedResponse: I get to wake up? Thank you, I'll try my hardest to make
    the best of this second chance!

  m_lifeEvents:
  - After waking up from the fatal injuries caused by an experimental gene altering
    machine, Grant realised that he had been gifted with special powers and took
    on the crime-fighting alter ego of Chancer - a superhero who would always give
    criminals the opportunity at a second chance.
