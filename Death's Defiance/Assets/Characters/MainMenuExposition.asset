  m_characterSentences:
  - You are the Grim Reaper.
  - Your job is to reap the souls of those who have died...
  - ...and guide them to the afterlife.
  - But... you also have a conscience, do you not?
  - 'You could perhaps choose to spare the souls... '
  - ...of those who have yet more to give...
  - ... who have important unfinished business on the mortal plane...
  - ... or simply those you deem worthy.
  - However, sparing souls is not without cost.
  - Their survival costs you your very essence as the Grim Reaper.
  - Reap and spare souls as you choose, but keep an eye on your DEATH POINTS...
  - Good luck.
